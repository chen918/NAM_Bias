This file contains several R scripts for the simulation study of the paper "Impact of Network Structure on Bayesian Estimation of Peer Effects for Linear and Generalized Linear Network Autocorrelation Models". Each script forms the standalone file with data generation and model estimation using Bayesian approach.
The R scripts heading with "sub_" are for the analysis of the impact of the number of independent sub-networks on estimating rho.
The R scripts heading with "wt_" are for the analysis of the impact of the variation of the edge weights across the weighted network on estimating rho.
The R scripts heading with "rec_" are for the analysis of the impact of the levels of reciprocity in a directed network on estimating rho.
The R scripts heading with "den_" are for the analysis of the impact of the network density on estimating rho.
The script names end with "linear", "binary" and "Poisson" are for the linear, binary and Poisson network autocorrelation model, respectively.
